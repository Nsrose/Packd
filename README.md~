RSF App Group
=============

Our Vision
-------------
We plan to make the Berkeley Recreational Sports Facility more accessible by providing users with information on the capacity and occupancy of the RSF. We predict that our app will also even out the variance between peak times and quiet times at the RSF as users will have the opportunity to optimize their workout schedules.

First Iteration
------------
Very simple app. Perhaps literally just the text “There are 40 people in the RSF right now, and the occupancy is 200 people.”
Second Iteration
------------
More informative visualization:
Graphs over time based on past data (the data would need to be saved in our back-end)
Nth Iteration
------------
More complex functionality:
- User preferences and notifications
- Predictive statistics

Team Structure
============
Our team is composed of members of the UC Berkeley CS Scholars Program. We are currently Sophomores studying Computer Science and we hope to learn a great deal as we develop our app!
